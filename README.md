## 🏗️ Project Structure

The app follows a feature-first structure with clear separation of concerns:

Auth → JWT-based authentication, middleware for protecting routes.

Backend →

1. server.js → Express API.

2. authMiddleware.js → Security.

3. serverData.json → Mock persistence.

Group → Create groups & list user groups.

Expense → Add expenses, calculate balances.

Core → HTTP interceptor & authentication guards.

Shared → Reusable Angular components, services, and utilities.

Build/Deploy → Production build artifacts inside dist/expense-tracking-project.

Routing → Authentication, group listing, and expense logging with guards.
